In this task, I'm required to build a REST API using the Flask framework in Python. The main purpose of this API is to manage user data by allowing different operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting users. These operations are performed using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, which are commonly used in RESTful services.
You will store the user information in a simple Python dictionary or an in-memory list, which means the data exists only while the program is running and no database is required. The Flask application will contain different endpoints (URLs) for each type of operation. For example, a GET request can be used to fetch all users, a POST request can be used to add a new user, a PUT request updates an existing user, and a DELETE request removes a user.
Once the API is created, you can test it using tools like Postman or Curl, which allow you to send different types of requests to your API and check the responses. The final output is a working Flask application that demonstrates how REST APIs function and how different HTTP methods are used to perform CRUD operations.
